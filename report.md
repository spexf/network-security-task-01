# Hands-On Lab Session: Virtual Lab Setup and Basic Traffic Analysis

## Introduction

### Objectives

- Set up virtual lab environment with Docker
- Capture traffic between client and web_server
- analyze the traffic in wireshark

### Overview

Simply in this practice, we have to set up a virtual lab environment with docker, there will be 2 container created in this practice, the first one is client, and the second one is web_server. Then after run the docker container, we have to capture the traffic that created between client and web_server when they're comunicating. Lastly, we will analyze the captured traffic in wireshark.
